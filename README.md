# CIPHER-OS: Pi-Pico Weather Station + ML Predictions

## Overview
CIPHER-OS is a microcontroller-based weather station that utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico and MicroPython to collect environmental data such as temperature and humidity. This project not only monitors real-time environmental conditions, and also employs a simple linear regression model to predict future weather trends.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: The core microcontroller for data collection and processing.
- **DHT11 Sensor**: Used for measuring temperature and moisture content in the air.

## Software Requirements
- **MicroPython**
- **LR Module**: Found in this repo.

## Usage
- **Data Collection**: The device collects temperature and humidity data at predefined intervals.
- **Data Prediction**:
  - The collected data is used to train a linear regression model.
  - The model predicts future environmental conditions based on historical data.
